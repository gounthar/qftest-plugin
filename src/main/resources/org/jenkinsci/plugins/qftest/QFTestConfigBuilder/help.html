<p> The QF-Test build step.
    Invokes QF-Test binary during your Jenkins job.
    If not listed in your PATH variable, the location of the QF-Test <b>binary</b> can be specified explicitly.
</p>
<p>
    The actual <b>test configuration</b> is set via pairs of <b>arguments</b> and <b>suite file</b> fields.
    The <b>Advanced Test result control</b> button allows to adjust the mapping between the QF-Test result and the Jenkins build result.
<p>
<p>
    All report files that are produced will be stored in an <b>output directory</b> relative to your workspace, whose structure is as follows:
<pre>
    &lt;LOGDIR&gt;
        ├── html        (HTML report directory)
        ├── junit       (junit report directory)
        └── qrz         (QF-Test runlogs)
    </pre>
The resulting runlogs are automatically declared as Jenkins build artificats and should appear as such on the Jenkins build page.
The junit and html reports can be processed further by the <tt>junit</tt> respectively the <tt>publishHTML</tt> plugin.
